Providing Data driven Insights to HR-Employee churning
**Understand the business scenario and problem**

In this project, The goal is to analyze the employee data collected by the HR department at Salifort Motors to help predict which employees are likely to leave the company. By building a predictive model, the goal is to identify key factors that contribute to employee turnover. This analysis will provide valuable insights to the HR team, enabling them to take proactive steps to improve employee satisfaction and retention. Reducing turnover can save the company time and resources spent on recruitment and training, making it a crucial initiative for improving overall business performance.

**Methodology**
To predict employee turnover, we employed a combination of machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression and Tree-Based Approaches (Decision Trees and Random Forest).

**Data Preprocessing:**

The employee data collected by the HR department was first cleaned and preprocessed to handle any missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Features were selected, and categorical variables were encoded to ensure compatibility with the machine learning models.

**Model Selection:**

Different models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The Random Forest model performed the best across all metrics and was selected as the final model due to its higher accuracy and robustness compared to the other models.
